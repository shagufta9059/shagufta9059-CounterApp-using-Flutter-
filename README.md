Counter-App-using-Flutter
i am doing intership at Robokalam my project is based on Android development so doing project using Flutter.

A simple Flutter app that displays a counter with two buttons: Add and Remove. The Add button increases the count by 1, while the Remove button decreases it by 1. The app uses StatefulWidget to manage and update the counter state dynamically in response to user interaction.
